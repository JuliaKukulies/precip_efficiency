# precip_efficiency
A project to study the precipitation efficiency in deep convective systems in k-scale model simulations and observations.

This repository contains
- code to derive and analyze various microphysical properties from 3D WRF output: microphysics_functions.py
- an example notebook for the offline calculation of condensation rates from model standard output
- various scripts to process model output from WRF idealized simulations and real climate simulations
